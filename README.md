# ServiceExample
Service is a part of thread which runs in the background. For instance, video downloading in the background, or a music player which is
played in the background of the main Thread. Here I have implemented the three threads at a same time. In addition, we have implemented this using Notification Builder. Play, Previous, Next were
the three threads running on the main thread. Apart from that, the services like running on background using Start Foreground and Stop Background which will destroy the service on onDestroy method.
